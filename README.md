### Installation
```sh
$  npm install -g yo
```
**Note:** Your user might not have the permissions to install package globally, so use a super user or **sudo**.

Once you have *yo* installed, you will need to install the **SEAN.JS** Stack generator as well:

```
$  npm install -g generator-seanjs
```

```
$ yo seanjs
```

You are now ready to get started with the SEAN.JS generator. The generator will help you create a SEAN application.
